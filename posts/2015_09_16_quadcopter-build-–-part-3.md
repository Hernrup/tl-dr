Summary: Took it for a spinn. With expected result.

## The story so far..

As I said in the assembly post.

- Those batteries I bought for extended flight time are huge. They weigh alot!
- The props the calculator told me I needed to carry those batteries are huge.
- The motors turning those props are reely quite a thing.

And most but definitly not least: 

- That is one big and scary f***** machine. 

## The first flight
 
 It was awesome.
 
 It started with a terribly powerfull sound.
 
 Lifted up nice and controlled. Good controller responce after a few tunings.
 
 Flew a nice 8 or 9 minutes untill I decided to mess things upp. I hate to
 disapoint and I did promise a crach.
 
My inability to hold a steady height quickly turned into a overcompensation 
followed by a undercompensation followed be a minor hole in the ground.

__Not to all:__ propeller guards do not function as you might think. 
Rather than taking the hit to protect the prop they bend very nicely into the prop
in order to guarantee the mutual destruction of both.

Now: Time to mount some new props and find a bigger field.
