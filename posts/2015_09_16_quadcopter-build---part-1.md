Summary: I was looking for a fun electronics project and got stuck on the idea of building a quad-copter. I will try to document the build as it goes forward. This post will be about the specs and the chosen parts.

The basic criteria for this build has been:

- A flight time of 15+ minutes
- Capable of lifting a decent camera and FPV equipment.
- Enough left over power to have decent maneuverability and keep fun flying characteristics.

To accommodate this it turns out that you need to scale things up a bit.. to 11 inch props at least in order to get a decent trade off on battery weight and flight time.

I have chosen a large frame (660 cm) in order to accommodate the large props and give it more stability in the air. The motors are quite slow (970 KV) but generates a lot of lift with the large props without drawing unreasonable amounts of battery power. Its is expected to carry 2 battery packs connected in parallel rather than one enormous pack in order to optimize the mA / kg ratio.

This is the basic calculations used for the build. I have used the excellent calculator over at www.ecalc.ch. I can not stress how much this service has been worth the few dollars that it costs. If I had run with my own, rather naive, choices i would have ended up with overheated engines and destroyed ESCs in no time. Not to talk about the small inconvenience of the 27s flight time ;).
